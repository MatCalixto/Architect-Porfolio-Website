# Portfolio Website
This project was made for an arquitect to display his portfolio, show all of his projects, a little more about who he is as a professional in the About Me section as well as contact information in the end of the page.
The page is also responsive, so can either be viewed in a wide screen device or smaller mobile devices.
Website Structure:
- Header: displays logo, navigation bar which changes colors when hovered and menu button for mobile users, disappears at the start of the page for an immersive full screen experience with the use of JavaScript.
- Banner: full screen image displaying a featured project the arquitect has made, scrolls slower than the rest of the page with the use of JavaScript, making a cool visual effect.
- Projects: a preview of some of the projects the arquitect has made, with a button for learning more information about the respective project.
- About Me: an about me section with a professional image of the arquitect, allowing him to talk about himself, who he is and what he envisions.
- Contact: a section full of contact information, be it email, telephone number or socia media links, it can be found there. 
- Pages showing more information about each of the projects, in detail.
