# Portfolio Website
This project was made for an architect to display his portfolio, show all of his projects, and a little more about who he is as a professional in the About Me section as well as contact information at the end of the page.

The page is also responsive, so can either be viewed on a wide-screen device or on smaller mobile devices.

Website Structure:

- Header: displays logo, navigation bar which changes colors when hovered and menu button for mobile users, disappears at the start of the page for an immersive full-screen experience with the use of JavaScript.
- Banner: full-screen image displaying a featured project the architect has made, scrolls slower than the rest of the page with the use of JavaScript, making a cool visual effect.
- Projects: a preview of some of the projects the architect has made, with a button for learning more information about the respective project.
- About Me: an about me section with a professional image of the architect, allowing him to talk about himself, who he is, and what he envisions.
- Contact: a section full of contact information, be it email, telephone number, or social media links, it can be found there. 
- Pages showing more information about each of the projects, in detail.
